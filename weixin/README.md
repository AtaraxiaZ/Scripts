This python script is used to send the Spring Festival blessing to my friends. Because Group-sent message isn't sincere and text
one by one needs a lot of time, So I used wxpy to customize message for everyone. I combine the name of my friend and the same 
blessing to a complete sentence, and send to one friend per second.
